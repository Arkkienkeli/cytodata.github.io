I am a researcher at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden. I am also an active member of the [BioImage Informatics Facility](https://biifsweden.github.io/) at the [Science for Life Laboratory](https://www.scilifelab.se/), where I support researchers in developing computational methods for analyzing microscopic images. I have a keen interest in the intersection of computer science and biology, and I have been working on multidisciplinary research projects in the biomedical field involving computer vision, machine learning, and data analysis.
