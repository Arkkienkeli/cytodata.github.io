I am a PhD student at the University of Copenhagen, at the Center for Protein Research in Niels Mailand [laboratory](https://www.cpr.ku.dk/research/proteinsignaling/mailand/). I work on genomic instability and DNA damage mechanisms; for this I develop and use deep learning models and multi-omics approaches.
