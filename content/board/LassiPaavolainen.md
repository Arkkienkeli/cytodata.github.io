I am a group leader at the [Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM)](https://www.fimm.fi). My research group focuses on developing and applying machine learning methods for image-based profiling of microscopy imaging data. We study deep learning methods to extract complex information from fluorescence microscopy images of human cell and tissue samples that are employed for instance in cancer precision medicine applications.
I was the CytoData society president 2020-2021.
