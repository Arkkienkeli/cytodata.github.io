I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [The German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (dzne)](https://www.dzne.de/en/research/research-areas/systems-medicine/research-groups/schultze/group-members/), Bonn. My research interest is in swarm learning for data-driven immune cell profiling to develop decentralized and privacy-preserving models for immune response analysis, with applications in pandemic preparedness.
