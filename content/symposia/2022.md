Cytodata 2022 will be hosted in-person by the Allen Institute for Cell Science in **Seattle, WA on October 17-20, 2022**. The Allen Institute for Cell Science is a division of the [Allen Institute](https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/cell-science/), whose mission is to create dynamic and multi-scale visual models of cell organization, dynamics and activities that capture experimental observation, theory and prediction to understand and predict cellular behavior in its normal, regenerative, and pathological contexts.

This year’s theme is “Data analysis and deep learning strategies for image-based profiling in cell biology.” We aim to feature new tools, applications of tools, and new discoveries to bring the image-based profiling community together.
