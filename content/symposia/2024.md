# Quick overview

We thrilled to announce that this year, CytoData is joining forces with [SBI2](<https://sbi2.org/>)! You can take part in the traditional CytoData Hackathon on September 17, and join from September 18-20 for an event supercharged in spatial and morphological profiling.

The main goal of this event is to bring together biologists and computer scientists to use [Morphological Profiling](https://www.broadinstitute.org/imaging/morphological-profiling) data to gain novel biological insights. You can bring your own question to the event or get together with experts and come up with one here. The idea is for everyone to have fun, learn how to use morphological data to ask/answer biological questions and meet other scientists with similar interests.

We strongly encourage both biologists to apply, regardless of their expertise in computational methods or their familiarity with the field of morphological profiling.

This event is part of the [SBI2](https://sbi2.org/conference/)+[Cytodata](https://www.cytodata.org/symposia/2024/) events.

# Prizes

We will offer two different tracks:

-   Best new biological story, or, how can we use JUMP to gain novel biological insight?
-   Best new tool/method, or, how to make JUMP data more accessible/develop a novel processing technique?

For each track there will be a 500 USD prize in giftcards for the winning team.

# FAQ


<a id="What%20is%20JUMP%3F"></a>

## What is JUMP?

JUMP stands for Joint Undertaking in Morphological Profiling. You can read more about the project [here](https://jump-cellpainting.broadinstitute.org/).


<a id="Can%20I%20access%20the%20data%20beforehand%3F"></a>

## Can I access the data beforehand?

The data is available right now, and you can see different ways to explore it [here](https://broad.io/jump).


<a id="Are%20teams%20assembled%20there%20or%20can%20I%20organize%20my%20own%20team%3F"></a>

## Are teams assembled there or can I organize my own team?

Both options are valid! The registration form contains a section to indicate whether you come with a team or not.

## How to get to the Broad Institute?

See the official [getting here](https://www.broadinstitute.org/getting-here) webpage.


<a id="Are%20there%20places%20to%20eat%20around%3F"></a>

## Are there places to eat around?

We will provide lunch and a light breakfast, but there are plenty of cafes and restaurants in the area.

## Whereabouts in the building will the event take place?

The start and lunch events will occur on the sixth floor section that connects 415 Main St. and 75 Ames (the room is called Serengeti).
For the hacking sessions people will be split between Serengeti and other locations in the M1 floor (Mezzanine)
There will be Broadies from the Imaging Platform who will show you the two floors and bring you to your floors and give you further indications.
