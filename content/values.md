We value interdisciplinary thinking and consider it critical to the success of this field. We strive to be a truly global society, preserving ethnic and geographical diversity and balance across demographic groups. By mandating that at least a fourth of the board comprise of early career researchers, we will encourage them to play a key role in decision-making. Individuals are considered early career if they either donâ€™t hold a PhD, or if they do, then are within eight years of receiving the degree.
